= Pre-Release Local Development Setup
:sectnums:

== Prerequisites

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository[Docker]
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository[Docker compose plugin]
* make
* sshuttle

== Basic Setup

This is the basic setup required to run the VDI stack locally.

[#basic-setup-setup]
=== Setup

. Clone the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/vdi-service[VDI Service Repo]
. `cd` into the cloned repo directory
. Copy the `example.min.env` file to a new file named simply `.env`
. Configure the `.env` file, filling in at minimum:
** `AUTH_SECRET_KEY`: Must be a valid value.
** `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`: May be any value, just can't be blank.
** `LDAP_SERVER`: Must be a valid value (or comma separated list of values)
** `ACCT_DB_USER`: Your account db username
** `ACCT_DB_PASS`: Your account db password
** `USER_DB_USER`: Your user db username
** `USER_DB_PASS`: Your user db password
** Find and replace all instances of `someDBUser` with your app db username
** Find and replace all instances of `someDBPass` with your app db password
. Optionally run `make build` to build the stack components, if this step is
  skipped, the latest image versions from Jenkins will be used.

[#basic-setup-run]
=== Run the Stack

. Start a `sshuttle` tunnel to a VEuPathDB server
. Run `make up` to start up the VDI service
. Check the VDI service logs by running `make log-service` to ensure the service
  starts up successfully.  The service will be available when the logs a bunch
  of debug lines about the worker pools starting up.

An example of such a log line:

----
2023-09-28 12:59:03.225 (wid:soft-delete-workers-10) [rid:init0] DEBUG org.veupathdb.vdi.lib.common.async.WorkerPool - worker pool soft-delete-workers starting worker 10
----

The VDI service should now be available at http://localhost:8080

[#basic-setup-stop]
=== Stop the Stack

. `cd` into the VDI service directory
. Run `make stop`

[NOTE]
--
This leaves the state of the containers and volumes on your device.  To reclaim
the space used by these pieces, follow the steps in
<<basic-setup-cleanup,Section 2.4>>.

[#basic-setup-cleanup]
=== Cleanup

To destroy the state of the VDI stack and reclaim all resources it used, follow
these steps.

. `cd` into the VDI service directory
. Run `make down`

== Plugin Developer

This setup is for plugin developers to be able to work on and test VDI plugins
against a running VDI stack.

=== Initial Setup

. Follow the steps in <<basic-setup-setup,Section 2.1>>
. Clone the target plugin(s).  (These plugins should _not_ be cloned into the
  VDI service directory)
. For each of the target cloned plugins:
.. `cd` into the plugin directory
.. Run `make build` to build the plugin image

=== Run the Stack

. Follow the steps in <<basic-setup-run,Section 2.2>>

=== Testing Plugin Changes

Once you have made your changes to the plugin scripts, follow these steps to be
able to test your changes in the VDI stack.

. Rebuild the plugin
.. From the plugin directory, run `make build`
. If the VDI stack is already running:
.. Shut down the VDI stack by following the steps in
   <<basic-setup-stop,Section 2.3>>
.. Restart the stack by performing the following:
... `cd` into the VDI service directory
... Run `make stop`
... Run `make start`
. Else, if the VDI stack was already shut down
.. Follow the steps in <<basic-setup-run,Section 2.2>>
