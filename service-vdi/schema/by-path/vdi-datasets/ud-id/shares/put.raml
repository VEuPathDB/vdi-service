          Either `grant` or `revoke`.

          A value of `grant` means the share should be offered to the user
          if they do not already have the dataset, or continue to be
          allowed if they already have access to the dataset.

          A value of `revoke` means the share should not be offered to the
          target user if they do not already have the dataset, or the
          sharing should be stopped if the user did already have access to
          the dataset.
