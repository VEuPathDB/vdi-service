== Tagging, Deployment, and Branch Rules

=== Branch Rules


==== `qa`

The `qa` branch is to reflect what is currently on QA.  Code may only be pushed
to this branch via pull request which depends on both approval and a successful
workflow build of the code.


==== `production`

The `production` branch should always reflect what is on production.  This
branch is to remain locked until we are ready to move code from QA to
production, at which point the following steps will be performed:

. The `production` branch will be unlocked via the repository settings.
. The `qa` branch will be merged into `production`
. The `production` branch will be re-locked via the repository settings.

[IMPORTANT]
--
These steps are *_not_* the service deployment steps, they are simply an outline
of steps strictly related to getting the `production` branch up to date with the
`qa` branch.  For deployment procedure steps see the <<Deployment>> section
below.
--


==== `main`

The `main` branch is for active development.  It is strongly advised that fixes
and features be developed on branches forked from `main` and then merged back
into `main` when complete to avoid conflict problems with other active
development.


=== Tagging

Release tags `v*` are only to be made on the `production` branch.

Other tags should be avoided.


=== Deployment

The following is a full list of steps necessary to perform a deployment of the
QA VDI service code onto production.

. Unlock the `production` branch via the repository settings.  This setting can
  be found in the "Branches" menu under the "production" branch rule.  The
  specific setting to uncheck is "Lock Branch".
. Merge the `qa` branch into `production`.
. Re-lock the `production` branch via the setting described in step 1.
. Wait for the `production` branch to build in Jenkins.
. Create a new release tag on the merge commit from `qa` to `production`.
. Wait for the new tag to build in Jenkins.
. Create a PR on the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/tagger[Tagger] repository,
  forked from and targeting the `prod` branch, updating the `vdi-service` tag
  to the new tag created in step 5.
. Assign the PR to systems and notify them of the PR.

[WARNING]
--
Steps 4 and 6 are necessary to avoid known issues with our current Jenkins build
setup for containerized services.

== Repo Structure

The VDI service repository is divided into 4 categories: components, daemons,
lanes, and the core bootstrapper.

Components are small shared libraries that contain code specific to a purpose
that is not the core focus of the VDI service.

Daemons are background processes that perform maintenance tasks such as dataset
reconciliation or pruning old, soft-deleted datasets from S3.

Lanes are event handlers that are tailored to individual event types, performing
some process or processes on a dataset specified in the subscribed events.

The bootstrapper is the core of the service, and the root level Gradle project.
This piece is responsible for starting up and shutting down the various project
modules.

=== Internal Libs

Shared library components used by one or more VDI daemons, lanes, the rest
service, and/or the bootstrapper.

=== Daemons

Background tasks that run unsupervised.

* link:service/daemon/event-router/[Event Router]
* link:service/daemon/pruner/[Pruner]
* link:service/daemon/reconciler/[Reconciler]

=== Lanes

Dataset event handlers.  Each lane is a separate process that subscribes to a
Kafka channel and operates on datasets whose information is provided in the
incoming events.

* link:service/lane/import/[Import Event Handler]

* link:service/lane/sharing/[Share Event Handler]
* link:service/lane/soft-delete/[Soft Delete Event Handler]
* link:service/lane/update-meta/[Update Meta Event Handler]


=== Rest Service

The rest service is the public API through which users and administrators
communicate with and operate on the VDI system.

* link:service/rest-service/[Rest API Service]

=== Bootstrapper

The bootstrapper is the core of the service, and the root level Gradle project.
This piece is responsible for starting up and shutting down the various project
modules.

* link:service/bootstrap/[Bootstrapper]

== Development

=== Running the Stack

. `make build` +
  Builds the VDI service docker image.
. `make up` +
  Spins up the service.
. `make down` +
  Shuts down the service and removes all the vdi-specific containers, volumes,
  and networks.
