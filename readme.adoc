== Repo Structure

The VDI service repository is divided into 3 categories: components, modules,
and the core bootstrapper.

The bootstrapper is the core of the service, and the root level Gradle project.
This piece is responsible for starting up and shutting down the various project
modules.

=== Components

Components are small shared libraries that contain code specific to a target
purpose that is not the core focus of the VDI service.

=== Modules

Modules are, in effect, separate services that are bootstrapped into a single
service by the bootstrapper.
