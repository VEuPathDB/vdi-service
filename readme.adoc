== Repo Structure

The VDI service repository is divided into 4 categories: components, daemons,
lanes, and the core bootstrapper.

Components are small shared libraries that contain code specific to a purpose
that is not the core focus of the VDI service.

Daemons are background processes that perform maintenance tasks such as dataset
reconciliation or pruning old, soft-deleted datasets from S3.

Lanes are event handlers that are tailored to individual event types, performing
some process or processes on a dataset specified in the subscribed events.

The bootstrapper is the core of the service, and the root level Gradle project.
This piece is responsible for starting up and shutting down the various project
modules.
