   * Executes the target command in the target working directory and calls the

   * This function waits to return until after the script has exited.
   *
   * **Example**
   * ```kotlin
   * // This sample execution runs "myCommand" in the directory "here" and
   * // requiring the execution of the command to complete within 3600 seconds
   * // then returns "success" or "failure" based on whether the command's exit

   * @param workDir Context directory from which the command will be executed.

   * @param arguments Optional array of additional arguments to pass to the
   * command being executed.
   *
   * @param environment Optional environment variables to set for the command
   * being executed.
   *
   * @param fn Function that is executed on the started [ScriptProcess]
   * instance.  This function will be called once, immediately after the target
   * command is started without regard to whether the command is still running
   * or has already exited.  The function is expected to make that determination
   * itself and act accordingly.
   *
   * @param T Return type of the function that consumes the running process.
   *
   * @return Returns the value returned by the given function.
