== Development Info

=== Responsibilities by Application Layer

==== 1. Controllers (JAX-RS)

Controller/resource classes serve as context injection containers for Jersey's
reflection-based functionality, granting access to necessary context to the
controller methods.

Controller methods are responsible for:

. Basic, non-domain-specific request-validation (such as ensuring params are
  not `null`).
. Deciding which service method(s) to call
. Passing necessary params and context to service method(s)
. Translating errors or wrapping generated model types in JAX-RS Response
  instances as needed.


==== 2. Service Methods (JAX-RS â®‚ VDI)

Service methods are responsible for:

. Lightweight, non-I/O input validation to ensure compatibility with model types
. Translating between generated RAML types and VDI types
. Orchestrating required model processes to fulfill the service request


==== 3. Model (VDI)

Model methods are responsible for:

. Performing data-driven input validation
. Operating with/on data sources
. Interacting with other external VPDB resources
