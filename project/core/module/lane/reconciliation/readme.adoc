= Dataset Reconciliation Lane

The reconciliation lane subscribes to an event channel for dataset
reconciliation events, and determines if the target dataset needs to be updated
in any downstream target system.

If a dataset is found to be absent from the stack-internal cache database, this
lane will create records for it.

If a dataset is found to be out of sync with a target system, the reconciliation
lane will fire additional events as necessary on the relevant event channels to
trigger other lanes into action.
