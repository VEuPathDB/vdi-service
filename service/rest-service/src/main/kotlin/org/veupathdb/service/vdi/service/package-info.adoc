This package contains the 'working parts' of request handling.  Apart from the
extension mixins defined in the Kotlin packages mirroring the Java `generated`
package, this is the deepest layer into VDI that generated types should reach.

Controllers should perform basic validation and/or dumb logic to determine what
primary path to take, and hand off request processing to methods defined in this
package or its subpackages.

A basic example may be as follows:

1. Jersey hands the inbound request to the controller method `Foo#postUsers`
2. `Foo#postUsers` validates the request and decides to create a user
3. `Foo#postUsers` calls `createUser(...)` from this package
4. `createUser(...)` calls out to VDI internals such as DB connection pools to
   perform the task.
