= `:lib:plugin`

VDI-internal libraries for working with the satellite VDI plugin services.

.Projects
* `:client` - Plugin client registry and implementations providing methods for
dependent code to interact with the VDI plugin services.
* `:registry` - Lightweight registry of the plugins that are enabled on a given
VDI instance.  Separated from `:client` for reuse in VDI modules that do not or
should not interact with the plugin services.
